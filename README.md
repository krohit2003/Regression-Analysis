Mentor: Sandipan Mitra
PART 1: MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION
Demonstrated the utility of linear regression for prediction using simple
examples such as Covid19 infection curves in New Delhi for a short period
of time. Built a model using python which was trained using health
insurance data to suggest ideal price of insurance based on factors such
as age, sex, BMI, smoking habits and location.
PART 2: POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION
Demonstrated rising CO2 levels by analyzing and fitting emission data with
polynomial curves of various degrees in Python.
